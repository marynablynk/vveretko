# Segments

## Overview

Segments allow you to organize dynamic or static lists of devices based on certain parameters (filters) or manual selection. There are two types of segments: static and dynamic.

### Static Segment

A static segment consists of a manual selection of devices. It remains unchanged unless manually updated.

**How to Create a Static Segment:**
1. Select multiple devices or users.
2. Use the **Add to Segment** option from the **Bulk Actions** menu.

### Dynamic Segment

A dynamic segment automatically updates based on filters. Any new device that matches the filter criteria will be added to the segment automatically.

**How to Create a Dynamic Segment:**
1. Apply filters in the **All** Segment view to refine your device list.
2. Click the **Save as Segment** button near the filter setup.

## Managing Segments

### Accessing Segment Actions

To manage segment actions:
1. Select the desired segment.
2. Click the three-dot icon next to the segment name.
3. A list of available actions will appear.

### Static Segment Actions

For static segments, you can:
- **Rename** the segment.
- **Delete** the segment.
- **Exclude specific devices:** To exclude a device, either open the table actions for the specific row or select multiple rows and use the bulk actions.
