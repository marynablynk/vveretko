# Device header constructor

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/20341bdb-5e1a-4881-895e-6e08b23ae969/45db1e25-5f32-4ea6-bea5-9f1d6f6dfe7d/Untitled.png)

The header constructor allows you to customize the header of your device according to your preferences. You can add important labels such as Connection Status and Last Reported timestamp, display an image inside the device's header, or assign Standalone Pages to the Header Buttons. You can also experiment with colors to make it more visually appealing.

# Header buttons

You can add up to 2 header buttons and assign a Standalone Page to each of them.

To add a header button, simply click the “plus” icon at the top of the header, and its settings will open.

## Header button settings:

**Datastream (optional)** - For setProperty.

**Page** - Select a page to open when pressing this button on the Device Dashboard. Only Standalone Pages are supported.

**Icon** - Define how this button will appear to the user.

**Appearance Animation** - The page can slide in from the bottom or from the right.

### **Change Header Properties**

You can change certain properties of the Header from your hardware. For that, use this command:

`Blynk.setProperty(vPin, "headerProperty", "propertyValue");`

Where:

`vPin` is: virtual pin number the widget is assigned to

`headerProperty`: property you want to change

`propertyValue`: value of the property you want to change

Don't put **`Blynk.setProperty()`**into the **`void loop()`** as it can cause a flood of messages and your hardware will be disconnected. Send such updates only when necessary, or use timers.

### **Properties you can change**

You can change the *isDisabled* and *isHidden* properties from your hardware, or via an [HTTP API](notion://www.notion.so/en/blynk.cloud). The URL must be encoded, so spaces in labels must be replaced with %20.

*Note that the header always contains two system buttons that cannot be edited: Timeline and Device Info.*

# Header Design

You can customize the appeal of the header by easily changing its size, color, adding a border, or modifying its content colors.

## How to change Header Design?

Press the "bucket" icon to access the Header Settings page.

### Header settings:

**Theme** - Define how the header will appear in different app themes.

B**ackground color** - Choose any color you want and the header background will change accordingly.

**Content design** - Select from Dark or Light content colors to ensure the header content looks good on your custom background.

**Datastream (optional)** - For setProperty.

**Border -** You can apply a bottom stroke or a shadow to the header body to separate it from other content.

### **Change Header Properties**

You can change certain properties of the Header from your hardware. For that, use this command:

`Blynk.setProperty(vPin, "headerProperty", "propertyValue");`

Where:

`vPin` is: virtual pin number the widget is assigned to

`headerProperty`: property you want to change

`propertyValue`: value of the property you want to change

Don't put **`Blynk.setProperty()`**into the **`void loop()`** as it can cause a flood of messages and your hardware will be disconnected. Send such updates only when necessary, or use timers.

### **Properties you can change**

You can change the *color* and *contentDesign* properties from your hardware, or via an [HTTP API](notion://www.notion.so/en/blynk.cloud). The URL must be encoded, so spaces in labels must be replaced with %20, and color hexadecimal values in the HTTP API URL must include the hash # character urlencoded as %23.

### Resizing

In the default state, the header size depends on its content. However, you can manually change the size by dragging the handle at the bottom of it.

Presets - maybe when the flow is finilized???

# Header Widgets

Header widgets enable the display of important information in the device header, such as battery level, the last reported timestamp, datastream value, and more.

## **Adding and Deleting**

To add a header widget, click on the "plus" icon located below the Template name, which will open the Widget Box. Select the desired widget from the available options.

Once the first widget is added, you'll notice two “plus” icons, enabling you to add widgets in different rows for enhanced customization.

To remove a widget, press on it to access its settings, and then tap the “trash” icon positioned at the top right corner. This will promptly delete the selected widget from your configuration.
